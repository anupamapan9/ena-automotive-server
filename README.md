# Ena Automotive Server

This project for an automotive parts manufacturer company. Who build the parts and whole sell them. 

## In this project ---
- In the `Server side` I used mongodb and express to handel all the functionalities. 
- Payment method processing so that we can store `TransitionId` on the DB
- JWT is used for secure the apis. So that no other can access the tokens and get the apis 
- Admin role implemented at the back end so that some api can only used bt the users 
- CURD operation used for the server side to make apis

## Technology Used
- cors
